        "E waste management campaign." : "Where can I throw away my old phone, tablet, laptop, used up wires, old refrigerators, TVs, radio and other electronic wastes in Kenya. It is sad that people will opt to throw their electronic wastes inside a pit latrine rather that properly disposing off the waste to centres that deal specifically with the collection of e-waste. The e-waste collection centre in kenya is called the WEEE Centre (Waste Electrical &amp; Electronic Equipment Centre) and it is located in Gitithia, Kiambu County. The centre has other branches across the country and members of UNICSA got a chance to visit the site on 23 rd September 2019 at Embakasi, Nairobi. The members actively participated in a campaign to bring awareness about the safe disposal of electronic wastes. In collaboration with Safaricom PLC the WEEE Centre managed the campaign which created a lot of awareness in Nairobi and its environs. It has been running since 2007 and so far, dumping of electronic waste has reduced a great deal around the city. There are several ways in which Kenyans can manage electronic waste and these include: 1. Be a good consumer. ... 2. Reuse as often as possible. ... 3. Educate yourself on what gets put into your electronics. ... 4. Look for an environmentally friendly label. ... 5. Consider limiting the number of electronics you own. ... 6. Teach kids about e-waste. ... 7. Recycle, recycle, recycle.. Electronic waste can be salvaged through recycling and this is why its important to take your e-waste to a centre specifically dealing with the disposal of e-waste rather than dumping carelessly. The dangers that result from improper dumping of e-waste include poisoning of the soil once the machines degrade and release heavy metals such as mercury &amp; zinc as well as radioactive energy. The campaign takes place every year and you can always trust on the members of UNICSA to create awareness on matters affecting the community.",
